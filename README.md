# arbitrary precision

This is A C++ library for arbitrary precision arithmetic.

As a user of this library, you can:

1. Implement all basic arithmetic operations (+, -, \*, /) on arbitrarily large integers,
   and rational numbers, with arbitrary precision.

2. Test whether a large integer is composite or (very likely) prime, using the Miller-Rabin algorithm.
